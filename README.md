## üì¶ Installation

### 1. External Dependency: FFmpeg (Required)

For audio conversion and playback, this application requires FFmpeg to be installed on your system.

- **macOS**: The easiest way to install it is via Homebrew:  
  ```bash
  brew install ffmpeg
  ```
- **Windows / Linux**: Download it from the [official website](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) and add it to your system's PATH.

---

### 2. Installing the Application

1. Go to the **"Releases"** or **"Tags"** tab.  
2. Download the version corresponding to your operating system.  
3. Unzip the `.zip` file.  
4. Place the application in the folder of your choice.  

---

### üí° Note for macOS

When launching the application for the first time, macOS will block it because it comes from an unidentified developer (unsigned application).

**Recommended procedure (Recent macOS versions)**  
1. Double-click the application icon (an error message will appear saying it cannot be opened).  
2. Open **System Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security**.  
3. In the **Security** section, click **Open Anyway**.  
4. Confirm the opening.  

‚ÑπÔ∏è On some older versions of macOS, it was sometimes possible to bypass the warning by right-clicking ‚Üí **Open**, but this method is no longer reliable on recent versions.

---

### First Launch: API Key

On first launch, the application will request your **Google Gemini API key**.  
It will be stored securely.
