John: [playful] Who am I? I am a little old lady. My hair is white. I have got a small crown and a black handbag. My dress is blue. My country's flag is red, white and blue. I am on many coins and stamps. I love dogs â€“ my dogs' names are corgis! Who am I?
Samantha: [amused] You're queen Elizabeth II!
