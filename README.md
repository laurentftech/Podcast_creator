   Download the latest **"release full"** ZIP archive (e.g., `ffmpeg-release-full.7z` or `.zip`).

2. **Extract the archive**  
   - Right-click the downloaded ZIP file and choose **Extract All‚Ä¶**  
   - You will get a folder named similar to `ffmpeg-2025-xx-xx-full_build`.

     ```
     sysdm.cpl
     ```
