## üì¶ Installation

### 1. External Dependency: FFmpeg (Required)

For audio conversion and playback, this application requires FFmpeg to be installed on your system.

- **macOS**: The easiest way to install it is via Homebrew:  
  ```bash
  brew install ffmpeg
  ```
- **Windows / Linux**: Download it from the [official website](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) and add it to your system's PATH.

---

### 2. Installing the Application

1.  Go to the **Releases** page.
2.  Download the latest archive for your system:
    *   **macOS/Linux**: Download the `.tar.gz` file (`..._MacOS_arm64.tar.gz` for Apple Silicon, `..._MacOS_x86_64.tar.gz` for Intel, or `..._Linux.tar.gz` for Linux).
    *   **Windows**: Download the `.zip` or `.tar.gz` file.
3.  **Extract the archive**:
    *   On macOS and Linux, double-clicking the `.tar.gz` file will extract the application. Then untar the .tar file using the command line:
    ```bash

### üí° Note for macOS Users

When you first run the application, macOS will show several security warnings because it's not from the App Store. This is perfectly normal and expected.

1.  **"App downloaded from the internet"**: You might see a dialog asking if you're sure you want to open the app. Click **Open**.
2.  **"Unidentified Developer"**: macOS will then likely block the app. An error message will appear. Click **OK** or **Cancel** on this dialog.
3.  **Allow the App to Run**:
    *   Go to **System Settings** ‚Üí **Privacy & Security**.
    *   Scroll down to the **Security** section.
    *   You will see a message saying `"Podcast Generator.app" was blocked...`.
    *   Click the **Open Anyway** button next to it and confirm.

The application will now launch, and you won't need to do this again.

### First Launch: API Key

On first launch, the application will request your **Google Gemini API key**.  
It will be stored securely.
